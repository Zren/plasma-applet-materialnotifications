# Material Notifications

A modified version of [plasma's notification widget](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-workspace/tree/master/applets/notifications). The widget can only be displayed in the bottom right since it needs to compile a C++ `plasmoid.nativeInterface` to detect the screen the widget is displayed on.
